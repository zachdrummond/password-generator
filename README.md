## Description
This is a app that generates a random password between 8 and 128 characters using lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. As technology advances, and hackers become more skilled, there is a greater need for more secure passwords. This app allows the user to customize their own password based on length and character preference.

This app was designed using mainly JavaScript.
